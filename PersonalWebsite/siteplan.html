      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Game Advertising</h3>
      <p>I have a best friend who shares the love I have for Nintendo. We’ve both grown up collecting games and consoles from the company and we always enjoyed the idea of starting a business selling and renting out wholesome games for people to play. That is what inspires me to make a website that would allow people to see what would be available.

        My website will introduce a clear view to my viewers that they can rent games for very low affordable costs (this would be local of course). They would also be able to purchase games and consoles (shipping would be included).
        
        My website also has some great features such as: Live Streaming, Music Performances, game tournaments.. Live Streaming includes these services [list]; music performances are on these dates [list]. Game tournaments are on these dates [list]
        
        There will also be a page for parents and reviews of Nintendo Franchises and what influences they would have on their kids.
         
        My selling proposition is that games should be available to those who want to play them at an affordable rate. Let people rent classic Nintendo Games for very cheap, and have good bundle deals for usually expensive items. I would have discounts on games that people have rented so that if they like it, they don’t have to spend more than they already have on it.
        
        I think Video Games should not be the biggest focus in people’s lives, especially kids. However, we live in an age where the video game industry is extremely influential. I feel at the very least, video games that kids play should have a positive influence on them and allow them to connect with other people in a good way. I feel that Nintendo has strove to do this.

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>-	Featured Games
        This section will contain images that features games that can be played and purchased at the store. A description beneath the image will give details about the game. The description will include: what year it was released, what platform it is available on, how many people can play it, and a brief summary of the game itself. In a more completed website, different games would be displayed after a certain point of time, about every week or few days.
        There will be three smaller images that display average games, and one large image that displays an iconic first-party title. There will be a link to a stream of this bigger game in its description.
        
      </p>
      <p>-	Deals
        Some games will have announced deals on the homesite. There will be discounts on games that are already being featured. The section for deals will be beneath the games being displayed. In the section, there will be images of current bundle deals, including consoles and games. This will display how much money is actually being saved.
        This section will also advertise that games and consoles can be rented for a brief period. More information will also tell the viewers games and consoles rented from the store can be used, and saved if rented multiple times, to a discount to the full price of the game and/or console if they wish to purchase said item.

      </ul>
      <h3>Streaming</h3>
      <p>
        -	Stream Gameplay
In this page, there will be a video where viewers can watch recorded gameplay of certain games. On the right side of the page, there will be a list of games that can be also be viewed. Clicking on these games will change the video on the page. There will be a small image for each game that will display the cover art of the game. However, this specific feature will not be added yet for simplistic sake, as this is only the demo.
Beneath the video that can be played, it will give a description of the game. There will also be a link to the player’s manual in the description. This description will have a “show more” feature that will hide the full description, to save room on the page. Beneath the description there will be official ratings and reviews for the game from certain sources (like IGN or Metacritic, etc.).

      </p>
      <p>A personal review of the game will also be given beneath the ratings by the owner the store for parents and the general public. It will be an express opinion what the game’s overall message and intended audience. A recommended age limit will be given and reasons for such will be given.</p>

      <h3>Events and Ordering</h3>
      <p>
        On this third page, a calendar will be displayed that will show upcoming events during the current month. These events will include sales events, tournaments, and party events with group games. The different events on the calendar can be enlarged when clicked on, and a longer description of the event can be viewed. This feature will probably not be used in the demo of the page.
      </p>
      <p>The contact for the business can be viewed on the footer in each page, which will include the phone number and email. A message can be expected to be responded to within twenty-four hours.</p>
      <p>Beneath the calendar, there will be a section where viewers will be able to order games and have them shipped to them. There will be a forum that will ask for: Name, Phone Number, Address, Form of Purchase, and which product they are buying. Once they fill out the form, the forum will send the customer confirmation that their order has been made. The status of the order will then be texted to the customer, when it has been shipped, it’s expected arrival, and when it has been delivered. This may not be included in the demo of the website. </p>
